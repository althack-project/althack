# Contributing to AltHack

First off, thanks for considering to contribute to AltHack! It's great having you here! :tada::+1:

This document outlines a set of guidelines for contributing to the AltHack project. Consider these mostly guidelines, not strict rules. Per situation, use common sense and good judgement - and if you see anything that can be improved in this document, feel free to propose a change in a pull request!

This document is work in progress at the moment. Its basic outline should give you an idea of how you can get in touch and what you can contribute to the project - and I'll make sure to extend this going forward, and as the priject progresses.

## Code of Conduct

To act as a friendly and welcoming community, every contributor or participant in the project is expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/althack-project/althack/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it carefully to make sure you agree to the project's community standards and expectations.


## Before you get started

Have a look at the [whitepaper](https://althack-game.com/althack-whitepaper/) and see if the project vision resonates with you. The project lives and thrives with its contributors, and a lively discussion can lead to great progress. This project is currently still in its infancy, which also opens up a lot of opportunities going forward. Join the effort and form the game as it materializes!


## How can I contribute to the project?

There is a [list of issues](https://github.com/althack-project/althack/issues) on GitHub which I will try to keep updated at all times. Not only current issues should be there, but also future tasks or potential side-topics that anyone can pick up and get started. If you have any questions, [send me a message](mailto:contact@althack-game.com) and I'll try to explain what is currently needed and why!


## Styleguide

The project has a style very similar to that of the [Google C++ Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). If you feel something is off or does not make sense, feel free to flag it via [email](mailto:contact@althack-game.com) or [open a discussion](https://github.com/althack-project/althack/discussions)! I'm working on adding clang support to the build chain to enforce certain rules - but until then, use good judgement, look at the already existing code, and ask if something isn't crystal clear!
