-------------------
Development Roadmap
-------------------

This section will be revised into time segments, release cadence, etc., but for the time being I'm
just collecting next steps and later make sense of their exact order and timing.

* Backend selection - When game starts, allow selection of server or client mode. Overridable
  through command line parameters.

* Account management in backend - At least in the server backend, accounts should be stored
  permanently and served to connecting clients.

* More to come
